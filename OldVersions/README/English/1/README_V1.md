## What is Google Green

Google Green also goes by Google Energy, and Google Environment. When first writing this article, I focused solely on the environmental impact, then tried to fill in the rest afterwards. It will take a while before this article is ready.

[Wikipedia: Google Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Google_Environment&oldid=1138981802&useskin=monobook)

> Google Energy LLC is a subsidiary company of Alphabet Inc., which was created to reduce costs of energy consumption of the Google Group, and subsequently to produce and sell clean energy. The division also allows it to take advantage of projects funded through the philanthropic Google.org. 

## Problems

### Lack of progress

This goal should have been achieved much earlier. This is now merely an attempt to not lose as bad. The environment should have been a consideration since the foundation of Google. Companies like DuckDuckGo have already achieved net zero emissions. Besides emissions, [Google Environment has wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on ineffective energy programs](#Waste-of-funds)

### eWaste

Google Green is an entirely pointless initiative for as long as Google continues to develop software with planned obsolescence. Even if Google goes carbon negative in their internal servers, there is still the problem of hundreds of millions of Android and ChromeOS devices being produced every year that are designed to be thrown out every 1-4 years, with no easy, feasible option to repair the device and keep using it.

It is mostly Samsung who makes the hardware, along with other companies, but Google has agreed to make the software cripple the hardware quickly, which results in excessive ewaste. Each device only supports 1-3 Android upgrades, meaning that devices no longer receive updates after 3-4 years of purchase (when they just come out)

Also remember that Google is one of the major contributors to the recent 2022-2023 semiconductor shortage for this very reason. All of the semiconductors (and other components) used to make these throwaway, disposable computers could have actually gone towards long-term, functional, and good computers.

### Waste of funds

Google spent over $580,000,000.00 (0.58 billion dollars) on the defunct company SolarCity, which was a highly controversial company that faced numerous lawsuits prior to its buyout by Tesla Inc/Elon Musk.

### Stealing energy

Google Energy has been buying out numerous wind and solar farms, and using the power for its own facilities, and then charging consumers for the leftovers, further leveraging Google as a monopoly. Google was approved to do this by the FCC.
